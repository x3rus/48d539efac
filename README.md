# Description


This is homework I have to do, I receive this instruction [INSTRUCTION.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)
sadly I did not find the CSV file mentioned, so I create my own file and performed validation after pushing the client in the app.

you will find all Kubernetes-related information info in the directory [k8s](./k8s) , I used a directory not_usable for the operation I tried but I did not have the right for it. I tried to create a pvc for MySQL data persistence.

You will find the python script in the directory [script](./script) I created with a small piece of unittest to show you what I can do.
I did not delete my branches, so you will be able to view the whole process.

Also, it's not for the homework it's because this is how I work (always), I create my personal not during the homework available here : [notes/README.md](./notes/README.md)
Please note it's a personal note, so the English are not the best ;), but help me to keep track...


Thanks have a nice day
